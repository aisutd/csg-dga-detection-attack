        "# **Using a GAN to create malicious domains**\n",
        "Just as machine-learning algorithms can be used to identify malicious domains, they can also be used to create domains that incorrectly-pass those checks. A popular method to generate such domains is using a Generative-Adversarial Network, otherwise known as a GAN.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **How does a GAN work?**\n",
        "A GAN is comprised of two models - a generator and a discriminator. These two models are pitted against each other. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating false input, and the discriminator tries to correctly identify the generator's false input mixed among correct ones.\n",

        "\n",
        "A noise vector (vector of random numbers) is passed into the generator, which uses the noise to generate an output. That output is combined with actual output from a dataset and shuffled then passed to the discriminator. The discriminator predicts where the images came from - the generator or the true dataset.\n",

        "If we just put in the tokenized domain into a GAN and expected it to easily generate fake tokenized domains with a good discriminator, we would find that the training would be highly-inefficient. This is because domains are maximum length 65. With 39 possible characters in each index in a domain, that would result in **65 * 39 = 2535 inputs per domain!** Also, domains are different lengths. This is hard for a GAN that needs a set number of inputs to deal with.\n",

        "To make this smaller, we use an _autoencoder_. It turns out that it is often possible to compress an array of numbers into a smaller-size array while still maintaining most of the important features of the array. This array of features is less-susceptible to being affected by different input lengths. Autoencoders perform this by having a \"bottleneck\" in the model.\n",

Many times, the same training would result in wildly-different outputs just because the random seed was different. This is the main issue holding GANs back. There have been papers applying GANs to domain-generating algorithms, which indicates that GANs can be used here. Yet, we could not replicate those results mostly due to the instability of GANs. In other words, GANs are extremely powerful yet extremely volatile at the same time.\n",
